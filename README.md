# What is This?

This repository represents various python coding projects I have worked on so far both independently and as part of Penn State University's
Web mapping and geospatial programming curriculum. This repository does not represent all the scripts that I have written during my time 
with Penn State, only those which I thought were easily distributable. 


## Description of each Project:

### Multiproc NOAA Shapefiles 
  This project was an independent work where I wanted to create a webscraping script which would pull the data from every NOAA operated 
  weather station and create unique shapefiles based on the weather stationID. This was done with use of the python multiprocessing module, BeautifulSoup, and arcpy.
  
### OSM QGIS Sample
  This project was a Penn State directed work where we were instructed to create a script which could parse an Open Street Maps .json file 
  and, by using a class hierarchy, create several geopackage layers of various hydro features for use in QGIS.  
  
### QT5 GUI Sample
  This project was a Penn State directed work where we were instructed to create a GUI using the python QT5 module which would allow the user to extract points from a user selected shapefile based on parameters selected within the interface.
